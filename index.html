    <h1 class="title">The Tragic Decision: Why Air India Express Flight 1344 Didn’t Go Around</h1>

    <p><em>In the critical moments before landing, why did the pilot of Air India Express Flight 1344 choose not to heed the Air Traffic Control’s ‘go around’ command—a decision that would soon prove catastrophic?</em></p>
    
    <p>On the evening of August 7, 2020, Air India Express Flight 1344 on its second landing attempt skidded off to the end of a tabletop runway at Kozhikode, sliding down an embankment, killing 19 passengers and both pilots.</p>

    <p>The Aircraft was a Boeing 737-800 / VT-AXH flying from Dubai International Airport, UAE and landing in Kozhikode International Airport, Kerala, India. The flight was on a Vande Bharat Mission to repatriate Indian nationals who were stranded due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

    <h2>What Exactly Happened?</h2>

    <p>The aircraft took off from runway 30R at Dubai International Airport on August 7, 2020, at 15:44 IST, carrying 184 passengers. After covering a distance of 2,673 kilometers, it reached Kozhikode airport on schedule, ready to land on runway 28. However, due to tailwind and faulty wipers, the landing was aborted, forcing the pilots to attempt a go-around and approach runway 10. The aircraft was flying at low altitude and high speed, worsening the already challenging landing conditions, especially with a high tailwind and wet runway.</p>

    <p>While making the second attempt to land on the runway 10, the aircraft gave a warning responding to which the pilot accelerated the engines which made the approach unstable and risky. The aircraft was faster and higher making it prone to failure. When seeing that they were now running out of runway, the pilot deployed thrust reversers and maximum brake pressure, but this did no good, causing the aircraft to skid off the runway and crash.</p>

    <h2>The Aftermath</h2>

    <p>The impact and compaction were severe causing the aircraft to break into three pieces. The passenger seats were thrown forward and became unattached. The overhead baggage compartments broke off, causing the luggage to fall out on the passengers. The maximum damage was between rows 2-10 and 22-26 where the aircraft broke up. Fuel had leaked, but it is thought that either the pilot or the aircraft crew turned off the engines, saving them from fire.</p>

    <h2>Evacuation</h2>

    <p>The situation inside the aircraft was chaotic. The cabin crew was unable to open the emergency doors, as they were blocked by the closet that had impacted forward. The cabin crew tried to evacuate all the passengers, directing them to the nearest exit on the plane to try to get out of it as soon as possible. There was a lot of debris, and the cabin crew was stuck, unable to help their passengers, leaving them in the hands of the firefighters who had arrived at the spot. The cabin crew used their phone flashlights to signal the firefighters and rescuers of their position. 17 passengers had immediately died due to the impact, which later rose to 21. Out of the total 169 survivors, 167 were injured and 75 were seriously injured. Survivors were rushed to the hospital. The nearby villagers also came to help and evacuate everyone.</p>

    <h2>The Cause</h2>

    <p>It is suspected that the main cause was bad decision-making by the pilot and not adhering to the safety operating procedures. The landing was not done properly from the start as the plane was touched ahead of the touchdown zone halfway around the runway, making the runway shorter for a wide-body aircraft to stop in time on a wet runway. Despite the call for a go-around, which could have avoided the crash, the pilot could not control the plane, causing a fateful crash. Apart from the pilot’s fault, there were a lot of contributing factors that caused the conditions to land to become worse. Such factors were:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Visual illusions as the wipers of the aircraft were faulty. The view was not clear, causing the pilot to have low visibility and confusion as to how much runway was left and where exactly they had placed the aircraft on the runway while landing.</li>
        <li>The ATC operator changed the runway in a hurry to accommodate the departure of another aircraft without considering the repercussions of the aircraft landing on a wet runway with high tailwind.</li>
        <li>High tailwind at 9 knots (17 km/h), wet runway, and rubber deposits affecting the braking performance of the aircraft.</li>
        <li>The pilot had previously landed an aircraft on that wet runway and was overconfident.</li>
        <li>The airline training and safety protocols were inadequate in addressing such situations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Such factors made the situation much worse, making it unavoidable to avoid a crash. This was marked as a serious case (DIC-22) by the aviation ministry, and it highlights the need to address issues from the overrun aircraft ground safety, poor visibility, to cockpit communication and training.</p>
